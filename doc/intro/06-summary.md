# Summary

OK, let's see where we are. By now, you should have:

* Gotten a basic Scala setup up & running;
* Written some basic & more advanced tests using ScalaTest & ScalaCheck;
* Parsed the cart & base product input files.

What you should do is now go ahead & write the remainder of the pricing calculator. We're deliberately going to leave this as an exercise for you. Before moving on from this section, you should ensure that you've completed the entire pricing calulator. We'll be building on it in the next sections.
